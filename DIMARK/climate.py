    This function calculates the coefficient modifying the net primary productivity (NPP) of biomass.
    
    Parameters:
    - avg_temp (float): Average annual temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - annual_precipitation (float): Annual precipitation in millimeters.
    - CO2_concentration (float): CO2 concentration in the atmosphere in ppm (parts per million).
